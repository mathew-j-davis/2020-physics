we need to come up with a topic for our experiment that's biologically relevant, to meet this criteria :
'link
the experiment and
physics principles to
biology.'

Using equipment and materials we can get our hands on while in lockdown, where there are things we can each contribute to in isolation.

Barring any general extension to the assignment deadline, I think we can assume we'll be finishing this off while in isolation.

Here's my first suggestion,
use a light meter like this:

(or a phone app is probably accurate enough) to measure how light attenuates through water.

This is biologically relevant because it determines the energy available for photosynthesis at depth in oceans and fresh water.

This paper is on a similar topic and links to relevant information.

I think that if you can rig up a trough with water in it (or a lucky enough to have a swimming pool in your back yard) and a light source and a phone in plastic bags we should be able to do this experiment.

I live close enough to the beach get some seawater and see how different that is.

Any other suggestions or thoughts?
