<h1>1.5 Problem-Solving Strategies</h1>
<h2>Learning Goal</h2>
<p>In this module you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply problem-solving steps and strategies to solve problems of one-dimensional motion.</li>
<li>Apply strategies to determine whether or not the result of a problem is reasonable, and if not, determine the cause.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Some people find solving physics problems challenging and they find it difficult translating the words into symbols that can be manipulated, calculated and graphed. But it's this translation from words to symbols that is the core of solving problems in physics.</p>
<p>To solve a problem more easily, it helps to break it down into a series of smaller steps. The following strategy consists of three steps: <em>prepare</em>, <em>solve</em>, and <em>assess</em>.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="3"><strong>Prepare</strong>: Identify important elements of the problem and collect information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span style="color: #cc0000;">Drawing a picture</span></p>
<p>The picture lets you model the problem and identify the important elements. As you add information to your picture, the outline of the solution will take shape. A picture could be a motion diagram or a graph.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span style="color: #cc0000;">Collecting information - Identify what you have and what you need</span><br />The problem's statement may give you some values of variables. Other information may be implied, or looked up in a formula sheet, or estimated or measured.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span style="color: #cc0000;">Preliminary calculation</span></p>
<p>Some calculations, such as unit conversions, are best done in advance.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Solve</strong>: Actually do the maths or reasoning necessary to arrive at the answer needed. But don't forget the Prepare step!</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="5"><strong>Assess</strong>: An important step. Once you have an answer, you should check to see whether it makes sense. Ask yourself these questions:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">Does my solution answer the question that was asked?</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Does my answer have the correct units and number of significant figures?</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Does the value I computed make physical sense?</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Can I estimate what the answer should be to check my solution?</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Does my final solution make sense in the context of the material I am learning?</td>

<p><span style="color: #9900ff;">WORKED EXAMPLE</span></p>
<p>A Saturn V rocket is launched straight up with a constant acceleration of 18 m/s<sup>2</sup>. After 150 s, how fast is the rocket moving and how far has it travelled?</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Prepare</strong>: A visual overview of the rocket launch with a motion diagram and a pictorial representation illustrates the motion of the rocket, identifies the important points of the motion, and defines variables. It is then important to identify what you have and what you need - a list of values that gives the known and unknown quantities.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Solve</strong>: The first task is to find the final velocity<em>. </em>From what we know in our list of values we can choose a kinematic equation to use. We know the initial velocity, the acceleration, and the time interval, so we can choose Equation 1 from our list of the kinematic equations in <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=880285&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=DeakinUniversity-1697880" target="_self">Module 1.4</a>. Then to find the distance travelled, we can use Equation 4.</td>

<p>To solve for the final velocity:</p>

<p>To solve for the distance travelled:</p>
<p><strong><img title="Solving 3" alt="Solving 3" src="../Images/Solving%203.jpg" width="951" height="270" /></strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Assess</strong>: The acceleration is very large, and it goes on for a long time, so the large final velocity and large distance travelled seem reasonable.</p>
