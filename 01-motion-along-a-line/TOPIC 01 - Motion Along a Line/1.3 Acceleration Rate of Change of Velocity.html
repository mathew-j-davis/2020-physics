<h1>1.3 Acceleration: Rate of Change of Velocity</h1>
<h2>Learning Goal</h2>
<p>In this module you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define and distinguish between acceleration and deceleration.</li>
<li>Calculate acceleration given initial time, initial velocity, final time, and final velocity.</li>
<li>Determine acceleration from a graph of velocity vs. time.</li>
<li>Determine the sign of acceleration.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Acceleration</h3>
<p>We have learnt so far that a change in position over a given time is an object's velocity (<a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=880285&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=DeakinUniversity-1697683" target="_self">Module 1.2</a>). We need to learn one more concept to complete the description of motion; one that will describe an object whose velocity is changing.</p>
<p>The rate of change of the velocity is called the <strong>acceleration</strong>. In everyday language, acceleration usually means 'an increase in speed'. However, in physics, we can change the velocity of an object by changing its speed (increasing OR decreasing it), by changing its direction, or by changing its speed <em>and</em> its direction.</p>

<p>The cheetah is the world's fastest land animal, with a maximum speed around 110 km/h. However, it is the cheetah's acceleration that makes it such an accomplished predator. It can accelerate from 0 km/h to 110 km/h in 4.0 s. What is the cheetah's average acceleration?</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Cheetah.jpg" alt="chetah" title="chetah" style="max-width: 100%;" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" /></p>
</td>
<td style="width: 523.406px;">
<p>We need to first convert the velocity into units of metres per second:</p>
<p><img title="accel prob 1" alt="accel prob 1" src="../Images/Accel%20prob%2013.jpg" data-d2l-editor-default-img-style="true" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That means that, on average, the cheetah increases its speed by 7.7 m/s every second.</p>
<p>Note that the direction can be represented by a signed number for one-dimensional movement. The positive number here means the cheetah's velocity is increasing.</p>

We can now find the <strong>acceleration-versus-time graph</strong> from the velocity-versus-time graph.</p>

<p>Finding an acceleration from a velocity graph. Both velocity and acceleration measure rates of change - velocity is the rate of change of position and acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Therefore, the graphical relationship of acceleration to velocity is the same as the graphical relationship of velocity to position.</p>
<p><strong>Acceleration is the slope on the velocity-versus-time graph.</strong></p>
</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The magnitude of the acceleration is a measure of how quickly the velocity is changing. But what does the sign of the acceleration (negative or positive) mean? It's not accurate to assume that a positive acceleration means an object is speeding up and a negative acceleration means it is slowing down. Because an object can move right or left (or, equivalently, up or down) while either speeding up or slowing down, there are four situations to consider.</p>

<p><strong>Determining the sign of the acceleration. </strong></p>
<p>Acceleration is a vector quantity.</p>
<p>Remember, by convention for horizontal motion, movement to the right corresponds to increasing <em>x</em> and a positive velocity <em>v</em>. Therefore, an object that speeds up as it moves to the right has a positive acceleration, but an object that speeds up as it moves left (negative <em>v</em>) has a negative acceleration.</p>
