<h1>01.0 Things to Do During Week 01</h1>
<p>Welcome to SLE123 Physics for Life Sciences!</p>
<h2>Seminar</h2>
<p>All seminars will use BlackBoard Collaborate. Go to <br /><strong>Content</strong> &gt; <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=880285&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=DeakinUniversity-2308488" target="_self">Bb Collaborate Ultra</a>&nbsp;. <br />There you will see links for several seminars. Choose the link corresponding to your session.</p>
<p>This week&rsquo;s seminar will focus on mathematics skills from Chapter 1 and Appendix A of the textbook.</p>
<p>Future seminars will focus on the content from the preceding week. The seminar in Week 2 will focus on the content from Week 1.</p>
<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>The prescribed textbook is Giambattista&rsquo;s <em>Physics</em>, 5th ed, McGraw-Hill, New York. This edition has a picture of the female hurdler on the front cover.</p>
<p>There are some second-hand copies of the 3rd edition of the textbook on the used-book market: the 3rd and 5th editions have the same content (the wording and explanations are slightly better in the later edition), but the main difference is that the questions have been re-written and/or re-numbered in the later edition. The older edition has a picture of the female gymnast on the front cover.</p>
<h3>Library copies</h3>
<p>All assessments in SLE123 in T2 2020 are open-text. The library has very limited copies of the textbook. You are strongly advised to purchase your own copy so that you are not disadvantaged in the assessments.</p>
<p>There are significant postal delays. If you must borrow a copy of the textbook from the library, you are strongly advised to borrow an electronic copy.</p>
<h2>Study Guide</h2>
<p>The <a href="../Seminars/SLE123_Study_Guide%202020.pdf" target="_self">SLE123 Study Guide</a>&nbsp;is available on the unit site. It has a detailed listing of the week-by-week textbook-section readings and expected learning outcomes. You are strongly advised to download a copy of the <strong>SLE123 Study Guide</strong> and to use it to guide your study.</p>
<h2>Calculator</h2>
<p>You will require the use of a scientific calculator (or better) in this unit. The calculator need to have (at least) 10x, COS, EXP (or ex), LOG, LN, SIN and TAN functions. Please make sure that you know how to use your calculator.</p>
<h2>Mathematics skills</h2>
<p>Most members of the class have not studied VCE mathematics, and the unit is designed to cater for this. There is a good summary of the maths skills in Chapter 1 and Appendix A of the textbook. Good summaries and hints are available in the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=880285&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=DeakinUniversity-1862786" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maths in Physics</a> page of this unit site. There is additional help available in the the <a href="https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/sites/student-life/pass/SitePages/Maths%20Mentors%20Timetable.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #0563c1; text-decoration: underline;">Maths Mentor</a>&nbsp;program, the SLE123 seminars, <a href="http://www.deakin.edu.au/pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS)</a>, <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/studying/study-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smarthinking and study support</a>. and from me, the Unit Chair.</p>
<h2>Weekly Quiz</h2>
<p>After you have completed the study of the content from Week 1, you are strongly advised to make the first attempt of <strong>Weekly Quiz 1,</strong> towards the end of this week (13-19 July).</p>
<h2>Teams for Experimental Demonstration task</h2>
<p>The <strong>Experimental Demonstration</strong> is the major assignment for this unit. It is worth 35% of the unit assessment. You will be assigned to teams of 3-4 for this task. Please make contact with your team members in the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=880285&amp;type=discuss&amp;rcode=DeakinUniversity-2918126" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experimental Demonstration</a>&nbsp;area within the unit site.</p>
<h2>Other things to do</h2>
<p>Please start a <strong>glossary of terms</strong>: try to define and summarise terms and concepts as they are introduced. Add to it with each module you do.</p>
<p>Please start a <strong>summary of key equations</strong>: try to summarise key equations and make sure you know how to use the equations in numerical calculations. Add to the list with each module you do. This summary will be useful in the online quizzes and in the examination.</p>
